# Code of Conduct

Available languages:

- [Spanish](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.es.md)

This repository contains the **iOS application** of the **DemyStudents** project, developed by a **closed and private team**.  
This Code of Conduct ensures a respectful, organized, and professional environment throughout development, following the team's architectural and workflow standards.

## 1. Respect and Communication
- Treat all team members with professionalism and respect.
- Resolve disagreements constructively and focus on solutions.
- Use the official team communication channels (e.g., Discord, WhatsApp).
- Provide feedback that is clear, actionable, and oriented toward improvement.

## 2. Responsibility and Commitment
- Deliver assigned tasks and features within agreed deadlines.
- Test your work locally in Xcode before submitting:
  - Successful build (`⌘B`)
  - Unit tests (`⌘U`) if applicable
  - Manual testing on simulator/device
- Inform the team in advance if you cannot meet a deadline or if blockers appear.
- Take ownership of your contributions and fix issues resulting from them.

## 3. Collaboration
- Review others’ Pull Requests with a supportive and constructive mindset.
- Follow the structure defined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md):
  - Feature-based folders (`Features/<Module>/Data|Domain|Presentation`)
  - Shared modules in `Core/`
- Respect naming conventions, commit standards (Conventional Commits), and the branching workflow (feature → develop → main).
- Avoid uploading unnecessary or generated files (e.g., DerivedData, .xcuserdata, build artifacts).

---

## 4. Work Quality
- Ensure code is clean, readable, and consistent with Swift, SwiftUI, MVVM, and Clean Architecture best practices.
- Verify UI correctness and accessibility (a11y) when modifying screens.
- Maintain documentation (README, architecture notes, diagrams) clearly and consistently.
- Double-check spelling, formatting, and screenshots before committing or submitting a PR.
- Keep diagrams, architectural documents, and exported assets synchronized with their editable sources.

## 5. Enforcement
This Code of Conduct applies to all members of the iOS team.  
Failure to follow these guidelines will be discussed and resolved by consensus within the group.  
Repeated violations may lead to limited participation in the project.

## 6. Security
- Do NOT publicly disclose vulnerabilities in Issues or Pull Requests.
- Follow the process described in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) to report them privately.
